Welcome to Instant RabbitMQ Messaging Application Development How-to. This book will give you a quick, step-by-step introduction into the world of RabbitMQ. We will demonstrate reasons for using RabbitMQ as we guide you through the process of decoupling a highly coupled e-commerce application using various messaging patterns allowing us to scale; improving responsiveness, performance, throughput and efficiency.
