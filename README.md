RabbitMQ is an open source message-broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) standard.  This book will enable you to take advantage of RabbitMQ to create scalable, message-based applications.

In "Instant RabbitMQ Messaging Application Development How-to" you start by understanding the reasons for using an AMQP message broker; you will then implement a simple messaging application.

You will then be guided through the process of decoupling an existing highly-coupled e-commerce application using messaging patterns and look at RabbitMQ options for reliable message delivery. Youâ€™ll finish your journey by exploring more advanced routing patterns. This book takes a highly practical approach we will offer numerous hints and tips for successful application development along the way.

Filled with practical, step-by-step instructions and clear explanations for the most important and useful tasks. Written in a practical, concise style, this book is complete with hands-on examples and the right amount of theory to get you started developing messaging applications with RabbitMQ.

Although the examples in this book are written in Node.js, a server side JavaScript platform for building fast scalable network applications no knowledge of RabbitMQ or Node.js is required. If you want to build scalable message based applications using RabbitMQ, then this book is for you!
